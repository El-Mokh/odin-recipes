    <h1>Lasagna Recipe</h1>
    <img src="/recipes/images/lasagna.jpg" alt="Lasagna" style="width:20%; height:auto;">
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling.<br>
        A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage<br>
        cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
    <h2>Lasagna Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ pound ground pork</li>
        <li>½ pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>Canned tomatoes</li>
        <li>Fresh herbs</li>
        <li>Spices and seasonings</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lasagna Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Gather all ingredients. </li>
        <li>  Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. </li>
        <li> Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. </li>
        <li> Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. </li>
        <li> While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes.
            <br> Drain and set aside. While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
        <li> Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined. </li>
        <li> Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. </li>
        <li> Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil. </li>
        <li> Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes. </li>
        <li> Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving. </li>
    </ol>
