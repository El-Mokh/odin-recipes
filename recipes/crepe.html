    <h1>Chicken Crepe Riviera Recipe</h1>
    <img src="/recipes/images/crepe.jpg" alt="Crepe" style="width:15%; height:auto;">
    <p>We have a lovely restaurant nearby and my first-ever order was their chicken crêpe riviera. This is my version.<br>
        The restaurant version doesn't have portobellos but I find they're a lovely addition and I love how easy it is to customize the flavors!</p>

    <h2>Chicken Crepe Riviera Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Combine milk, flour, and eggs in a blender. Blend until smooth, about 1 minute. </li>
        <li> Heat a nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Brush hot pan with a small amount of butter. Ladle about 3 tablespoons of batter into the center of the pan. Tilt pan from left to right to cover entire surface. Sprinkle top of the crepe with 1 or 2 teaspoons of basil. </li>
        <li> Cook until edges begin to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip crepe over and cook until set, about 2 minutes more. Remove to a plate. Cook remaining batter, re-brushing pan with butter and stacking crepes with parchment paper in between. </li>
        <li> Mix chicken, grapeseed oil, balsamic vinegar, and salt together in a resealable zip-top bag; marinate for 20 to 30 minutes. </li>
        <li> Drain and discard marinade. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken; cook and stir until juices run clear, about 5 minutes. </li>
        <li> Place broccoli in a microwave-safe bowl with 2 tablespoons water. Microwave until crisp-tender, 3 to 4 minutes. </li>
        <li> Combine butter and garlic in the same skillet over medium heat. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the broccoli; stir to coat with the garlic butter. Stir in tomatoes and mushrooms and heat through. </li>
        <li> Stir cream, cheese, and pesto together in a separate saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir until sauce comes together, 3 to 5 minutes. </li>
        <li> Lay a crepe on a plate, line chicken filling down the middle, and drizzle sauce on top. Fold crepe over burrito-style; spoon more chicken and sauce over top. Repeat with remaining crepes, filling, and sauce. </li>
    </ol>
