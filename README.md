# Odin Recipes

Welcome to **Odin Recipes**, a simple recipe website created as part of my journey to learn HTML. This project is a practice exercise from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## About
This is the first version of the website, built entirely with pure HTML. Future updates will include CSS for improved styling and layout.

## Features
- A homepage with links to individual recipe pages.
- Each recipe page includes:
    - A title
    - An image of the dish
    - A list of ingredients
    - Step-by-step cooking instructions

## Future Enhancements
- Adding CSS for better design and responsiveness.
- Improving accessibility and user experience.

## How to View
1. Clone this repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/odin-recipes.git
     ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to explore the recipes.

Happy coding!
